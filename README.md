### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

Iâ€™m Diego, a software engineer.

I love creating modern ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

Outside of code and Figma, youâ€™ll usually find me playing music, hitting the gym, creating content, or diving into video games. I also enjoy sharing tech-related content on social media (10K+ followers and counting).  

#### Fun Facts:

* I love coffee.
* I consider myself a bit weird (and probably have a touch of ADHD ðŸ˜…)
