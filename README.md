Iâ€™m Diego, a software engineer passionate about creating lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.  

Outside of code, youâ€™ll usually find me playing music, hitting the gym, creating content, or diving into video games. I also enjoy sharing tech-related content on social media (10K+ followers and counting).  

## Fun Facts:
- I love coffee â˜•  
- Coding is my escape ðŸ’»  
- Iâ€™m really into video games ðŸŽ®  
- I consider myself a bit weird (and probably have a touch of ADHD ðŸ˜…)
