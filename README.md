# Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

Iâ€™m Diego, a software engineer passionate about creating lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.  

Outside of code, youâ€™ll usually find me playing music, hitting the gym, creating content, or diving into video games. I also enjoy sharing tech-related content on social media (10K+ followers and counting).  

## Fun Facts:
*I love coffee â˜•  
*Coding is my escape ðŸ’»  
*Iâ€™m really into video games ðŸŽ®  
*I consider myself a bit weird (and probably have a touch of ADHD ðŸ˜…)
